This is a paper in year 2011.
It seems that Monte Carlo is beated by Mini-Max search in this papaer.
In the paper, the author constrain the Monte Carlo to simulate 10000 games in a ply,
while the mini-max search is simply a 4-layer min-max(he doesn't mention the evalution function at all).
It is quite astonishing that the Monte Carlo algorithm he tuned is defeated by the naive 4-layer mini-max algorithm(45:53).

Not mention that if our Monte Carlo can simulate 10000 in the time limit or not, if its mini-max search had been applied
prunning, move choosing, better evalution function and deeper layer search.

It's time to consider not to put too much time on Monte Carlo?
